The skin fade is a very short haircut style that requires cutting hair shorter down the sides and back, and gradually blending the cut into the skin. Also known as a bald fade, this type of fade haircut is an edgy and bold look that needs regular visits to the barber to maintain. You can combine the bald fade haircut with trendy hairstyles to create a stylish look. Whether you want a high, mid or low skin fade, talk to your barber about adding this feature to your cut.
