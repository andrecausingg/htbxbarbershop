The fade is a menâ€™s haircut where the hair on the sides and back of your head gradually get shorter from top to bottom. The process of fading from one length to another is generally achieved using hair clippers. Because the fade comes in a variety of styles, it is important to tell your barber the type of fade haircut you want. You can choose a low, mid or high fade to determine where the cut is tapered. You can also decide how short to fade the cut by asking for a bald fade, which will blend your hair into your skin.
