Also known as a taper, the taper fade is a clean-cut modern haircut that continues to be popular in barbershops. The main difference between the taper and fade is that the fade cut is blended into the skin while the taper leaves very short hair. The taper is an incredibly chic and classy look that any man can get to elevate his appearance.
