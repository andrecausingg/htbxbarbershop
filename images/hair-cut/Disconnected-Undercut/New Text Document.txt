The disconnected undercut features a sharp contrast between the long hair on top and shorter sides rather than the gradual blending of a taper or fade. As a cool hairstyle for guys, the disconnected undercut is both bold and handsome. The contrast will be beneficial for men with round or oval face shapes to add some angular features, but every guy can achieve this cut.
