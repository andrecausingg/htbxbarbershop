The pompadour is a timeless menâ€™s hairstyle that features longer hair in the front with short hair on the sides and back. Classy and handsome, the pompadour involves the hair being styled up and back away from the forehead, showing off your hair with some volume. Pompadour styles are ideal for guys with thick, straight, or wavy hair. Because volume is essential to the look, use a product with a high hold like a pomade, putty, or gel to make sure your hair stays put throughout the day.
