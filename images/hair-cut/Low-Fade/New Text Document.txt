The low fade features a more even and gradual blend between the short hair around the ears and the longer hair near the crown than other taper or fade haircuts. The low fade is more subtle than some of the other fade options but no less stylish by any means. As with any fade, youâ€™ll want regular cuts to maintain the clean look. The low fade pairs exceptionally well with some stubble or a short beard.
