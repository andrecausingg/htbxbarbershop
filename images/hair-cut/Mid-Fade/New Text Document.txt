The mid fade strikes the perfect balance between a high and low fade, creating a bold yet effortlessly cool look. A mid fade haircut is a cut that starts in the middle of the head and tapers down to the ears and neckline. This medium fade gradually blends the short sides and back into the longer hair, and can be the ideal complement to a stylish business professional hairstyle. You can ask your barber for a mid bald fade for an edgy finish. If youâ€™re looking to take the first steps into a more trendy haircut, then the mid cut fade would be a great choice.
