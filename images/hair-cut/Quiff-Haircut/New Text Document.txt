The quiff is another classic menâ€™s hairstyle that is very similar to the pompadour. They both feature hair that is styled back and up away from the forehead with volume. The quiff differs from the pompadour by first brushing the hair forward before styling it up and back, and is typically a more casual and messy hairstyle for men. Coupled with a fade cut on the sides, the quiff haircut is versatile and trendy for guys with all hair types.
