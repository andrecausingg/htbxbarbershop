The undercut is a very popular modern haircut where the sides and back are clipped short or shaved. Traditionally, the undercut haircut features a full disconnect and is not faded, and the hair on top is left much longer. Some guys will ask their barber to taper the cut to create an undercut fade. The undercut can be combined with a range of men’s hairstyles to create a trendy look. The hair on top can be combed over, swept to the side, slicked back, brushed up, styled into a pompadour, or made to get a quiff. Ultimately, the undercut is one of the coolest “short on the sides, long on the top” haircuts you can have these days.
